<h1>Discord Captcha Method</h1>
<p>This example provides a method to check whether the User is using the Discord-Client or not. Through an 1 x 1px Image in an Embed, we can check if the CDN requested this image (Twice, first time by sending the Image as a bot, the second time when the Client loads the image). If only one request is made to the resource, the User might be a selfbot, because Images aren't loaded.</p>
